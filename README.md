# safe-config-service

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/gnosis/safe-config-service/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/gnosis/safe-config-service)

The `safe-config-service` is a service that provides configuration information in the context of the Safe clients environment (eg.: list of available safe apps and chain metadata).

## Requirements

- `docker-compose` â€“ https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
- Python 3.12.2

## Setup

In order to start the server application:

#### 1. Install the required Python dependencies. Eg.: With a python virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv venv # creates a virtual environment venv in the local directory
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install setuptools
```

#### 2. Launch the Postgres database image

```shell
docker compose up -d db
```

#### 3. Execute pending database migrations

```shell
python src/manage.py migrate
```

#### 4. Create an admin user

The admin interface of the service will be available under `http://localhost:8000/admin` but you need to have an admin registered before you are able to access the panel.

To create an admin user:

```shell
python src/manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### 5. Launch the service:

```shell
python src/manage.py runserver
```

By default the service will be available under http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Configuration

The service is already configured for development purposes however if you wish to deploy it in a production environment you should set some sensitive parameters such as: `POSTGRES_USER`
, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `SECRET_KEY`.
`DEBUG` should be set to `false`.

We provide the `.dev.env` file which explains the role of each environment variable. You can set the configuration using this file and read it in terminal session where the application will be
executed.

## Testing

Pytest is used to run the available tests in the project. **Some of these tests validate the integration with the database
so having one running is required**. From the project root:

```shell
docker compose up -d db
pytest src
```

## Code Style Formatter and Linter

[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) are the tools used to validate the style of the changes
being pushed. You can refer to the documentation
of these tools to check how to integrate them with your editor/IDE.

```shell
isort --profile black src # sorts imports according to the isort spec with a profile compatible with Black
black src # formats the files in the src folder using Black
flake8 src # runs flake8 Linter in the src folder
```

There's also a pre-commit hook that you can install locally via `pre-commit` so that it formats the files changed on each commit automatically:

```shell
pre-commit install # installs commit hook under .git/hooks/pre-commit
git commit # Initially this can take a couple minutes to setup the environment (which will be reused in following commits)
```
